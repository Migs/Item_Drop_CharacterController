<h1>IGDO Item Drop Character Controller Walkthrough</h1>
<p>In this workshop we will learn how to create characters and have them move left and right using player input.</p>

<p>First, we will open Unity Hub and create a new project.
You can name it whatever you want, but I will name it Item_Drop.</p>
